= Releasing an application

Two teams work together to release an application:

* *Development team* - The team that develops and supports the application in a pre-production environment.

* *Managed environment team* - The team that supports the production instance of that application.

[1] When an application is ready for release, the Development team contacts the Managed Environment team; for example, their organization's SRE team, requesting access to the Managed environment for the first production release.

[2] The Managed environment team creates the managed environment and responds to the development team with the managed environment's configuration details. The Managed environment inherits some details of the development teamâ€™s workspace. However, the development team has limited access to the production environment, which is a part of the managed environment.

[3] The development team creates a matching configuration in their environment that is same as that of the Managed environment and attempts to release the application to production.

[4] The Managed environment team validates the initial release and configures a traffic gateway, which allows external traffic to the application.

.Next steps

* *Create a `releasePlan` object:* The development team creates a ReleasePlan object in the developer workspace. The ReleasePlan object includes a reference to the application that the development team wants to release, along with workspace where the application is supposed to be released.

* *Create a `releasePlanAdmission` object:* The Managed Environment team creates or updates the ReleasePlanAdmission object in response to the ReleasePlan object created by the development team. It indicates that the Managed Environment team has approved the application specified in the ReleasePlan object.

* *Releasing an application (auto or manual):* The Managed Environment team runs the `copy-application.sh` script by defining the application name before releasing an application to production. The script copies the application and all of its components from the Development to the Managed workspace. As a result, when releasing an application to production, the Managed Environment team uses the application on its workspace rather than the one on the Developer workspace. Additionally, if the Development team adds a new component to the application on their workspace, they must notify the Managed Environment team. So they can run the `copy-application.sh` script again to ensure that the managed workspace has the most recent version of the application.
